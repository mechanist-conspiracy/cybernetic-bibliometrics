# Cybernetic Bibliometrics Project
The main intent here is to take a material culture approach to the question 'what is cybernetics?' by examining the artifacts used to propagate the discipline. Books are accordingly prioritized to the extent that they are meant to teach a discipline called 'cybernetics' and not to expound on a particular cybernetic argument, . We would like to see what content books have in common, how they differ in their attention to topics, and where they draw material from. For this purpose, indices and bibliographies will be transcribed into a consistent JSON format for comparison. Bibliographies may be further translated to bibtex.

The current priorities are:

**Tier one (highest priority)**

Ashby. _An Introduction to Cybernetics_.

Glushkov. _Introduction to Cybernetics_.

George. _Foundations of Cybernetics_.

Lerner. _Fundamentals of Cybernetics_.


**Tier two**

George. _Cybernetics and Biology_.

George. _Cybernetics_.

Weiner. _Cybernetics_.

Pask. _An Approach to Cybernetics_.


**Tier three**

Lange. _Introduction to Economic Cybernetics_.

Arbib. _The Metaphorical Brain_.

Greniewski. _Cybernetics Without Mathematics_.

Pamely-Evens. _An Introduction to Industrial Cybernetics and Instrumentation_.
