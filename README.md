# Cybernetics Textbooks Project
Books are prioritized according to their orientation toward cybernetic pedagogy. That is to say, they are meant to teach a discipline called 'cybernetics' and not to expound on a particular cybernetic argument. The main intent here is to take a material culture approach to the question 'what is cybernetics?' by examining the artifacts used to propagate the discipline. In particular, we would like to see what content books have in common, how they differ in their attention to topics, and where they draw material from. For this purpose, indices and bibliographies will be transcribed into the JSON format. Bibliographies may be further translated to bibtex.

The current priorities are:

**Tier one (highest priority)**

Ashby. _An Introduction to Cybernetics_.

Glushkov. _Introduction to Cybernetics_.

George. _Foundations of Cybernetics_.

Lerner. _Fundamentals of Cybernetics_.


**Tier two**

Greniewski. _Cybernetics Without Mathematics_.

Pamely-Evens. _An Introduction to Industrial Cybernetics and Instrumentation_.

George. _Cybernetics and Biology_.

George. _Cybernetics_.

Weiner. _Cybernetics_.

Pask. _An Approach to Cybernetics_.

Lange. _Introduction to Economic Cybernetics_.
